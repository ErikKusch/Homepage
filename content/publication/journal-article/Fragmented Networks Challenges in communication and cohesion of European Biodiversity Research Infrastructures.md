title: Fragmented Networks - Challenges in communication and cohesion of European Biodiversity Research Infrastructures
abstract: European Biodiversity Research Infrastructures (BioRIs) play a central role in addressing the complex challenges in biodiversity research, scientific collaboration across disciplines and national boundaries, as well as informing the public and policy-makers about the status and challenges of the European biodiversity. Our study focuses on the communication and coordination amongst BioRIs and revealed important fragmentation in communication strategies both within and across the key European BioRIs — including DiSSCo (Distributed System of Scientific Collections), eLTER (Integrated European Long-Term Ecosystem Research), GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and LifeWatch ERIC. This fragmentation manifests in uneven geographical representation, inconsistent communication practices and limited data and service cohesion, ultimately impeding collaboration and the efficient use of resources. While some initiatives to tackle this issue demonstrate the potential for harmonisation, the the broader systemic challenges still persist. We argue that overcoming these barriers will require the development of standardised communication frameworks, more equitable distribution of infrastructures and deeper understanding of domain-specific differences that currently hinder the interoperability. Our study demonstrates the urgent need for coordinated efforts to integrate European BioRIs into a more coherent and accessible research ecosystem capable of addressing the biodiversity challenges of the 21st-century.
