summary: This is a series of lectures and seminars designed for B.Sc. students of biology and should serve as an introduction to the basics of biostatistics using R. I taught these topics at the University of Leipzig but invite everyone who stumbles across this page to make use of what I'm presenting here as all of my material has been designed with the students interest in mind and should thus be self-sufficient.

    - Be able to judge the applicability of individual methods
2 Basic proficiency in using `R`
    - Know base commands and how they function
    - Be able to prepare biologically relevant data sets for further analysis
    - Be able to apply basic statistical methods to biologically relevant data sets
3 Research Design
    - Understand how to formulate testable hypotheses
