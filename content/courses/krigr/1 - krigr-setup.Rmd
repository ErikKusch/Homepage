<!-- # Setting Things Up & Preparing the Workshop -->
## Installing `KrigR`
First of all, we need to install `KrigR`.

<!-- {{% alert info %}} -->
Until we have implemented our [development ideas and goals](https://github.com/ErikKusch/KrigR/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement), `KrigR` will not be submitted to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) to avoid the hassle of updating an already accepted package. For the time being, `KrigR` is only available through the associated [GitHub](https://github.com/ErikKusch/KrigR) repository.
<!-- {{% /alert %}} -->

Installation of an `R`-Package from GitHub is facilitated via the `devtools` package and its `install_github()` function. Thus, `KrigR` can be installed and loaded as follows:

{{% alert danger %}}
As `KrigR` is currently undergoing substantial development in response to the establishment of a new CDS and deprecation of previous dependency packages, you have to install the latest development version.
{{% /alert %}}

```{r InstallKrigR, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/ErikKusch/KrigR", ref = "Development")
library(KrigR)
```


## CDS API Access

{{% alert danger %}}
If you have used `KrigR` or CDS services before 2024-09-16, please be advised that a new CDS has been established and you will need to create a new account and register your new user credentials with `KrigR` to ensure continued use of it.
{{% /alert %}}

Before you can access [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/) (CDS) products through `KrigR`, you need to [register an account at CDS](https://accounts.ecmwf.int/auth/realms/ecmwf/login-actions/registration?client_id=cds&tab_id=13GUMw5dlhU). Don't forget to accept the terms and conditions:

<img src="TermsConditions.png" alt=""  />

Once you have created your account, you can find your API credentials on your personal page (which you access by clicking your name in the top-right corner of the webpage) on the CDS webpage:

<img src="APIKEY.png" alt=""  />

Once you have done so, we recommend you register the user ID and API Key as characters as seen below (this will match the naming scheme in our workshop material):

```{r APICredentials, eval = FALSE}
API_User <- "youremail@somethingortheother"
API_Key <- "YourApiKeyGoesHereAsACharacterString"
```

{{% alert success %}}
You are now **ready** for `KrigR`.
{{% /alert %}}

If this is your **first contact** with `KrigR`, we recommend strongly you **follow the workshop material in order**. If you **return to** `KrigR` with specific questions or ideas, we recommend you make use of the **search function** at the top left of this page. If you are short on time, the [quick start](/courses/krigr/quickstart/) guide will be useful to you.
