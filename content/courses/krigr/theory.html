<h2>Climate Reanalyses</h2>
<p>Climate reanalyses are the go-to data products for climate scientists and represent the best-in-class approximations of climate characteristics across the Earth.</p>
<p>The accuracy of climate reanalyses is largely owed to the number of observations assimilated, the underlying dynamical model, and the data assimilation methodology. Furthermore, climate reanalyses offer access to a vast array of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) at unparalleled temporal resolutions. Lastly, as reanalyses are created from multiple models (i.e.Â ensembles), we can obtain data uncertainty for each data record.</p>
<p>To our mind, this makes climate reanalyses the gold standard in climate data products for use in macroecological analyses.</p>

<h2>The <code>KrigR</code> Package</h2>
<p>The <code>KrigR</code> package has been designed to overcome the major stop-gaps in integrating climate reanalyses data into our research frameworks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Accessing, downloading, and processing of climate reanalysis data<br />
</li>
<li>Matching spatial resolutions which downstream applications have become used to</li>
</ol>
<p>For an introduction to <code>KrigR</code> in presentation form, please have a look at these <a href="/courses/krigr/KrigRDemo.html" target="_blank">Slides</a>.</p>
