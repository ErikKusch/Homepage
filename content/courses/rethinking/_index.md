## Learning Goals
The material presented here is aimed at providing the reader with:  

1. A solid grasp of Bayesian statistics  
    - Have an overview of Bayesian principles  
    - Be able to formulate Bayesian frameworks  
    - Know how to interpret outputs of Bayesian frameworks  
2. Ability to execute Bayesian statistics  
    - Know how to apply the `rethinking` package  
    - Have an initial overview of STAN functionality  


## Contents
- We follow the material noted further down under Group Material  
- We prepared ourselves by working through the material noted for each session in the Preparation Column in Proposed [Timeline](/project/aubayes/Schedule.pdf)  
- At the start of each session, I quickly presented a summary of the preparation material.
