## Material
 
Most of the material in these chapters has already been covered in previous material, so the following summary is rather brief:

- [Bayesian Network Inference](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ErikKusch/Homepage/blob/master/content/courses/bayes-nets/8-Bayesian-Network-Inference_08-11-22.html)

Please refer to earlier material for introductions of queries, structure learning, and parameter learning in theory and in `R`.

## Exercises
These are answers and solutions to the exercises at the end of chapter 4 in [Bayesian Networks in R with Applications in Systems Biology](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-6446-4) by by Radhakrishnan Nagarajan, Marco Scutari \& Sophie Lèbre and Part 4 in [Bayesian Networks with Examples in R](https://www.bnlearn.com/book-crc/) by M. Scutari and J.-B. Denis. Much of my inspiration for these solutions, where necessary, by consulting the solutions provided by the authors themselves as in the appendix.

### `R` Environment
For today's exercise, I load the following packages:
```{r}
library(bnlearn)
library(gRain)
library(GeneNet)
library(penalized)
```

### Nagarajan 4.1 
> Apply the junction tree algorithm to the validated network structure from Sachs et al. (2005), and draw the resulting undirected triangulated graph.

Taken directly from the solutions:

<img src="/courses/bayes-nets/Nagarajan4_1.JPG" width="900"/>

### Nagarajan 4.2 
> Consider the Sachs et al. (2005) data used in Sect. 4.2.

First, let's read the data in like it was done in the book:

```{r}
isachs <- read.table("sachs.interventional.txt", header = TRUE, colClasses = "factor")
isachs <- isachs[, 1:11]
for(i in names(isachs)){levels(isachs[, i]) = c("LOW", "AVG", "HIGH")}
```

This .txt file can be downloaded from [here](https://www.bnlearn.com/book-useR/code/sachs.interventional.txt.gz).

#### Part A
> Perform parameter learning with the `bn.fit` function from `bnlearn` and the validated network structure. How do the maximum likelihood estimates differ from the Bayesian ones, and how do the latter vary as the imaginary sample size increases?

```{r}
sachs_DAG <- model2network(paste0("[PKC][PKA|PKC][praf|PKC:PKA]",
                                 "[pmek|PKC:PKA:praf][p44.42|pmek:PKA]",
                                 "[pakts473|p44.42:PKA][P38|PKC:PKA]",
                                 "[pjnk|PKC:PKA][plcg][PIP3|plcg]",
                                 "[PIP2|plcg:PIP3]")
                           )
f4.1_mle <- bn.fit(sachs_DAG, isachs, method = "mle")
f4.1_bayes1 <- bn.fit(sachs_DAG, isachs, method = "bayes", iss = 1)
f4.1_bayes10 <- bn.fit(sachs_DAG, isachs, method = "bayes", iss = 10)
f4.1_bayes100 <- bn.fit(sachs_DAG, isachs, method = "bayes", iss = 100)
```

I omit the outputs of the individual objects created above here for space. 

From a theoretical standpoint mle estimates may contain NA values while bayes-inferred estimates do not. That being said, I did not see any NA outputs in the maximum likelihood estimates here.

As far as iss is concerned, higher iss values result in smoother estimates.

#### Part B
> Node `PKA` is parent of all the nodes in the `praf → pmek → p44.42 → pakts473` chain. Use the junction tree algorithm to explore how our beliefs on those nodes change when we have evidence that `PKA` is `“LOW”`, and when `PKA` is `“HIGH”`.

```{r}
mle_jtree <- compile(as.grain(f4.1_mle))
query <- c("praf", "pmek", "p44.42", "pakts473")

## baseline query
querygrain(mle_jtree, nodes = query)

## low evidence
mle_jprop <- setFinding(mle_jtree, nodes = "PKA", states = "LOW")
querygrain(mle_jprop, nodes = query)

## high evidence
mle_jprop <- setFinding(mle_jtree, nodes = "PKA", states = "HIGH")
querygrain(mle_jprop, nodes = query)
```

`PKA` inhibits all other nodes. When `PKA` is `HIGH` then the `LOW` probability of all other nodes increases.


When `PKA` is `HIGH`, the activity of all the proteins corresponding to the query nodes is inhibited (the `LOW` probability increases and the `HIGH` decreases). When `PKA` is `LOW`, the opposite is true (the LOW probability decreases and the `HIGH` increases).

#### Part C
> Similarly, explore the effects on `pjnk` of evidence on `PIP2`, `PIP3`, and `plcg`.

```{r}
mle_jprop <- setFinding(mle_jtree, nodes = c("PIP2", "PIP3", "plcg"), 
                        states = rep("LOW", 3))

## baseline query
querygrain(mle_jtree, nodes = "pjnk")

## low evidence
querygrain(mle_jprop, nodes = "pjnk")
```
Turns out `pjnk` is unaffected by the others. The DAG shown in the answers to exercise Nagarajan 4.1 supports this.


### Nagarajan 4.3 
> Consider the marks data set analyzed in Sect. 2.3.

```{r}
data(marks)
```

#### Part A
> Learn both the network structure and the parameters with likelihood based approaches, i.e., BIC or AIC, for structure learning and maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters.

```{r}
f4.3_dag <- hc(marks, score = "bic-g")
f4.3_dag
f4.3_bn <- bn.fit(f4.3_dag, marks)
f4.3_bn
```

#### Part B
> Query the network learned in the previous point for the probability to have the marks for both `STAT` and `MECH` above 60, given evidence that the mark for `ALG` is at most 60. Are the two variables independent given the evidence on `ALG`?

```{r}
cpquery(f4.3_bn, event = (STAT > 60) & (MECH > 60), evidence = (ALG <= 60), n = 1e7)
cpquery(f4.3_bn, event = (STAT > 60), evidence = (ALG <= 60), n = 1e7)
cpquery(f4.3_bn, event = (MECH > 60), evidence = (ALG <= 60), n = 1e7)
```

The conditional probability of the two outcomes (`r cpquery(f4.3_bn, event = (STAT > 60) & (MECH > 60), evidence = (ALG <= 60), n = 1e7)`) is not the same as the product of their corresponding marginal probabilities (`r cpquery(f4.3_bn, event = (MECH > 60), evidence = (ALG <= 60), n = 1e7)*cpquery(f4.3_bn, event = (STAT > 60), evidence = (ALG <= 60), n = 1e7)`). Conclusively, we can say that `STAT` and `MECH` are not independent conditional on `ALG`.

#### Part C
> What is the (conditional) probability of having an average vote (in the [60,70] range) in both `VECT` and `MECH` while having an outstanding vote in `ALG` (at least 90)?

```{r}
cpquery(f4.3_bn, 
        event = ((MECH >= 60) & (MECH <= 70)) | ((VECT >= 60) & (VECT <= 70)),
        evidence = (ALG >= 90), 
        n = 1e7)
```

### Nagarajan 4.4 
> Using the dynamic Bayesian network `dbn2` from Sect. 4.3, investigate the effects of genes `257710_at` and `255070_at` observed at time t-2 on gene `265768_at` at time t.

This is the network in the chapter according to the errata corrige [here](https://www.bnlearn.com/book-useR/):
```{r}
data(arth800)
subset = c(60, 141, 260, 333, 365, 424, 441, 512, 521, 578, 789, 799)
arth12 = arth800.expr[, subset]
x = arth12[1:(nrow(arth12) - 2), ]
y = arth12[-(1:2), "265768_at"]
lambda = optL1(response = y, penalized = x, trace = FALSE)$lambda
lasso.t = penalized(response = y, penalized = x, lambda1 = lambda, trace = FALSE)
y = arth12[-(1:2), "245094_at"]
colnames(x)[12] = "245094_at1"
lambda = optL1(response = y, penalized = x, trace = FALSE)$lambda
lasso.s = penalized(response = y, penalized = x, lambda1 = lambda, trace = FALSE)
## errate comes in here
dbn2 = empty.graph(c("265768_at", "245094_at1",
        "258736_at", "257710_at", "255070_at",
        "245319_at", "245094_at"))
dbn2 = set.arc(dbn2, "245094_at", "265768_at")
for (node in names(coef(lasso.s))[-c(1, 6)]){dbn2 = set.arc(dbn2, node, "245094_at")}
dbn2 = set.arc(dbn2, "245094_at1", "245094_at")
dbn2.data = as.data.frame(x[, nodes(dbn2)[1:6]])
dbn2.data[, "245094_at"] = y
dbn2.data[, "245094_at1"] = arth12[2:(nrow(arth12) - 1), "245094_at"]
dbn2.fit = bn.fit(dbn2, dbn2.data)
## errata stops here
dbn2.fit[["265768_at"]] = lasso.t
dbn2.fit[["245094_at"]] = lasso.s
```

This is the solution to the exercise:
```{r}
set.seed(42)
cpquery(dbn2.fit, event = (`265768_at` > 8), evidence = (`257710_at` > 8))
cpquery(dbn2.fit, event = (`265768_at` > 8), evidence = (`255070_at` > 8))
cpquery(dbn2.fit, event = (`265768_at` > 8), evidence = TRUE)
```

High expression levels of gene 257710_at at time t −2 reduce the probability of high expression levels of gene 265768_at at time t; the opposite is true for gene 255070_at.


### Scutari 4.1 
> Consider the survey data set from Chapter 1.

The data can be obtained from [here](https://www.bnlearn.com/book-crc/):

```{r}
survey <- read.table("survey.txt", header = TRUE, colClasses = "factor")
```

Remember, this is the corresponding DAG we know to be true: 

<img src="/courses/networksscutari/Fig1.1.JPG" width="900"/>

#### Part A
> Learn a BN with the IAMB algorithm and the asymptotic mutual information test.

```{r}
s4.1_dag <- iamb(survey, test = "mi")
s4.1_dag
```

#### Part B
> Learn a second BN with IAMB but using only the first 100 observations of the data set. Is there a significant loss of information in the resulting BN compared to the BN learned from the whole data set?

```{r}
s4.1_dagB <- iamb(survey[1:1e2,], test = "mi")
s4.1_dagB
```

We discover far fewer arcs!

#### Part C
> Repeat the structure learning in the previous point with IAMB and the Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo mutual information tests. How do the resulting networks compare with the BN learned with the asymptotic test? Is the increased execution time justified?

```{r}
s4.1_dagC_mcmc <- iamb(survey[1:1e2, ], test = "mc-mi")
s4.1_dagC_mcmc
s4.1_dagC_smc <- iamb(survey[1:1e2, ], test = "smc-mi")
s4.1_dagC_smc
```

We do not discover more arcs, and the outputs of the two asymptotic tests are equal for this case:

```{r}
all.equal(s4.1_dagC_mcmc, s4.1_dagC_smc, s4.1_dagB)
```

### Scutari 4.2 
> Consider again the survey data set from Chapter 1.

The data can be obtained from [here](https://www.bnlearn.com/book-crc/):

```{r}
survey <- read.table("survey.txt", header = TRUE, colClasses = "factor")
```

#### Part A
> Learn a BN using Bayesian posteriors for both structure and parameter learning, in both cases with `iss = 5`.

```{r}
s4.2_dag <- hc(survey, score = "bde", iss = 5)
s4.2_bn <- bn.fit(s4.2_dag, survey, method = "bayes", iss = 5)
modelstring(s4.2_bn)
```

#### Part B
> Repeat structure learning with hc and 3 random restarts and with tabu. How do the BNs differ? Is there any evidence of numerical or convergence problems?

```{r}
s4.2_hc <- hc(survey, score = "bde", iss = 5, restart = 3)
modelstring(s4.2_hc)
s4.2_tabu <- tabu(survey, score = "bde", iss = 5)
modelstring(s4.2_tabu)
```

The Bayesian networks inferred here differ quite substantially in their DAG structures. 

The random-start hill-climbing algorithm builds a DAG structure closer to the validated structure which is supported by the `score`: 

```{r}
score(s4.2_hc, survey)
score(s4.2_tabu, survey)
```

#### Part C
> Use increasingly large subsets of the survey data to check empirically that BIC and BDe are asymptotically equivalent.

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.keep="ALL"}
set.seed(42)
breaks <- seq(from = 10, to = 100, by = 10) # percentage of data
analysis_df <- data.frame(bde = NA,
                          bic = NA,
                          breaks = NA)
for(k in 1:1e3){
 bde_vec <- c()
 bic_vec <- c()
  for(i in breaks){
    samp <- sample(1:nrow(survey), nrow(survey)/i)
    samp <- survey[samp, ]
    s4.2_bde <- hc(samp, score = "bde", iss = 5)
    s4.2_bic <- hc(samp, score = "bic")
    bde_vec <- c(bde_vec, score(s4.2_bde, survey))
    bic_vec <- c(bic_vec, score(s4.2_bic, survey))
  }
 analysis_df <- rbind(analysis_df,
                      data.frame(bde = bde_vec,
                                 bic = bic_vec, 
                                 breaks = breaks))
}

analysis_df <- na.omit(analysis_df)

plot(x = analysis_df$breaks, 
     y = abs(analysis_df$bde-analysis_df$bic))
```


### Scutari 4.3
> Consider the marks data set from Section 4.7.

```{r}
data(marks)
```

#### Part A
> Create a bn object describing the graph in the bottom right panel of Figure 4.5 and call it `mdag`.

```{r}
mdag <- model2network(paste0("[ANL][MECH][LAT|ANL:MECH]",
                             "[VECT|LAT][ALG|LAT][STAT|LAT]")
                      )
```

#### Part B
> Construct the skeleton, the CPDAG and the moral graph of `mdag`.

```{r}
mdag_skel <- skeleton(mdag)
mdag_cpdag <- cpdag(mdag)
mdag_moral <- moral(mdag)
```

#### Part C
> Discretise the marks data using "interval" discretisation with 2, 3 and 4 intervals.

```{r}
dmarks_2 <- discretize(marks, "interval", breaks = 2)
dmarks_3 <- discretize(marks, "interval", breaks = 3)
dmarks_4 <- discretize(marks, "interval", breaks = 4)
```

#### Part D
> Perform structure learning with hc on each of the discretised data sets; how do the resulting DAGs differ?

```{r}
hc_2 <- hc(dmarks_2)
modelstring(hc_2)
hc_3 <- hc(dmarks_3)
modelstring(hc_3)
hc_4 <- hc(dmarks_4)
modelstring(hc_4)
```

Quite evidently, as we increase the number of intervals, we break conditional relationships so much so that fewer arcs are identified. 

## Session Info
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
