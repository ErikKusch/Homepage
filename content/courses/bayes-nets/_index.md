## Learning Goals

The material presented here is aimed at providing the reader with:  

1. A solid grasp of Bayesian networks  
    - Have an overview of Bayesian principles  
    - Be able to formulate Bayesian networks  
    - Know how to interpret outputs of Bayesian networks  
2. Ability to execute Bayesian network analyses  
    - Know how to apply the `bnlearn` package  

## Contents

- We follow the material noted further down under Group Material  
- We prepared ourselves by working through the material noted for each session in the Preparation Column in Proposed [Timeline](/project/bayesnets/Schedule.pdf)  
- At the start of each session, I quickly presented a summary of the preparation material.
