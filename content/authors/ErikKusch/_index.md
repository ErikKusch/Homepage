## Hi. I'm **Erik Kusch**, a senior engineer at the [Natural History Museum of the University of Oslo](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/) where I manage research infrastructure for the [BioDT project](https://biodt.eu/).

Using big data and generating novel statistical methodology, I aim to understand how global and local processes and patterns in biological systems come about and are reinforced thus generating knowledge about the resilience of the Earth's ecosystems. 

I am currently also working towards publication of manuscripts related to my [PhD project](/project/phd-packages/) at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/) which focused on ecological interactions and the networks they form at macroecological scales as well as their usefulness for biodiversity forecasting and our capability or inference thereof.

In my free time, I escape to the mountains and engage in landscape and wildlife photography.
