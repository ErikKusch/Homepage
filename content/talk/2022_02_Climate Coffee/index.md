abstract: Erik and colleagues have created an R-Package for download, temporal aggregation, masking, and statistically interpolating ERA5(-Land) data. The publication within which they present the R-Package (`KrigR`) itself has just been accepted (https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac48b3). In a different publication published previously (https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac39bf) Erik and colleagues demonstrated how data obtained through the KrigR framework relate to previously offered ready-made data sets and why they strongly believe that data handling pipelines (rather than ready-made data sets) are the way forward for downstream analyses.
